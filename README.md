# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
I recently completed a project focused on Breast Cancer Prediction using both Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The goal was to build a model capable of accurately classifying breast tumors as either malignant or benign using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. Throughout the project, I applied various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Deep Learning Sequential Model. After thorough comparisons, I observed that the models achieved impressive accuracies, with Logistic Regression and the Deep Learning model performing particularly well.
